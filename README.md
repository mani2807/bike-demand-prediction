## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
- In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- We want to predict, which variables are important in predicting the demand for shared bikes and how well those variables describe the bike demands?

## Conclusions
- From the analysis, it is evident that year is one of the most significant factor that affects the demand for bikes. In this given dataset, 2019 has more demand in comparision with 2018 (might be starting point of boombikes - there may be other reasons)
- Temperature has a positive impact on the sharing of bikes
- Summer has a positive impact on the bike shaing demand whereas sprint has a slightly negative demand
- Demand was high while there was a mist and when the cloud was clear, and had a negative impact when there was a rain
